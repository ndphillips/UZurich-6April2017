  abstract={It is difficult to overestimate Paul Meehl's influence on
                  judgment and decision-making research. His
                  `disturbing little book' (Meehl, 1986, p. 370)
                  Clinical versus Statistical Prediction: A
                  Theoretical Analysis and a Review of the Evidence
                  (1954) is known as an attack on human judgment and a
                  call for replacing clinicians with actuarial
                  methods. More than 40 years later, fast and frugal
                  heuristics—proposed as models of human judgment—were
                  formalized, tested, and found to be surprisingly
                  accurate, often more so than the actuarial models
                  that Meehl advocated. We ask three questions: Do the
                  findings of the two programs contradict each other?
                  More generally, how are the programs conceptually
                  connected? Is there anything they can learn from
                  each other? After demonstrating that there need not
                  be a contradiction, we show that both programs
                  converge in their concern to develop (a)
                  domain-specific models of judgment and (b) nonlinear
                  process models that arise from the bounded nature of
                  judgment. We then elaborate the differences between
                  the programs and discuss how these differences can
                  be viewed as mutually instructive: First, we show
                  that the fast and frugal heuristic models can help
                  bridge the clinical—actuarial divide, that is, they
                  can be developed into actuarial methods that are
                  both accurate and easy to implement by the unaided
                  clinical judge. We then argue that Meehl's
                  insistence on improving judgment makes clear the
                  importance of examining the degree to which
                  heuristics are used in the clinical domain and how
                  acceptable they would be as actuarial tools.}

  abstract={The general problem of forming composite variables from
                  components is prevalent in many types of research. A
                  major aspect of this problem is the weighting of
                  components. Assuming that composites are a linear
                  function of their components, composites formed by
                  using standard linear regression are compared to
                  those formed by simple unit weighting schemes, i.e.,
                  where predictor variables are weighted by 1.0. The
                  degree of similarity between the two composites,
                  expressed as the minimum possible correlation
                  between them, is derived. This minimum correlation
                  is found to be an increasing function of the
                  intercorrelation of the components and a decreasing
                  function of the number of predictors. Moreover, the
                  minimum is fairly high for most applied
                  situations. The predictive ability of the two
                  methods is compared. For predictive purposes, unit
                  weighting is a viable alternative to standard
                  regression methods because unit weights: (1) are not
                  estimated from the data and therefore do not
                  “consume” degrees of freedom; (2) are “estimated”
                  without error (i.e., they have no standard errors);
                  (3) cannot reverse the “true” relative weights of
                  the variables. Predictive ability of the two methods
                  is examined as a function of sample size and number
                  of predictors. It is shown that unit weighting will
                  be superior to regression in certain situations and
                  not greatly inferior in others. Various implications
                  for using unit weighting are discussed and
                  applications to several decision making situations
                  are illustrated.}

  abstract={Proper linear models are those in which predictor
                  variables are given weights such that the resulting
                  linear composite optimally predicts some criterion
                  of interest; examples of proper linear models are
                  standard regression analysis, discriminant function
                  analysis, and ridge regression analysis. Research
                  summarized in P. Meehl's (1954) book on clinical vs
                  statistical prediction and research stimulated in
                  part by that book indicate that when a numerical
                  criterion variable (e.g., graduate GPA) is to be
                  predicted from numerical predictor variables, proper
                  linear models outperform clinical
                  intuition. Improper linear models are those in which
                  the weights of the predictor variables are obtained
                  by some nonoptimal method. The present article
                  presents evidence that even such improper linear
                  models are superior to clinical intuition when
                  predicting a numerical criterion from numerical
                  predictors. In fact, unit (i.e., equal) weighting is
                  quite robust for making such predictions. The
                  application of unit weights to decide what bullet
                  the Denver Police Department should use is
                  described; some technical, psychological, and
                  ethical resistances to using linear models in making
                  social decisions are considered; and arguments that
                  could weaken these resistances are presented.}

                  mistake. A good fit reveals nothing about the
                  flexibility of the theory (how much it cannot fit),
                  the variability of the data (how firmly the data
                  rule out what the theory cannot fit), or the
                  likelihood of other outcomes (perhaps the theory
                  could have fit any plausible result), and a reader
                  needs all 3 pieces of information to decide how much
                  the fit should increase belief in the theory. The

                  predicts), assess how firmly actual outcomes agree
                  with those constraints, and determine if plausible
                  alternative outcomes would have been inconsistent
                  with the theory, allowing for the variability of the

                  recognition experiments involving artificial data as
                  well as handwritten numerals. In way of conclusion,
                  we suggest that current-generation feedforward
                  neural networks are largely inadequate for difficult
                  problems in machine perception and machine learning,
                  regardless of parallel-versus-serial hardware or
                  other implementation issues. Furthermore, we suggest
                  that the fundamental challenges in neural modeling

  abstract={Models of decision making are distinguished by those that
                  aim for an optimal solution in a world that is
                  precisely specified by a set of assumptions (a
                  so-called “small world”) and those that aim for a
                  simple but satisfactory solution in an uncertain
                  world where the assumptions of optimization models
                  may not be met (a so-called “large world”). Few
                  connections have been drawn between these 2 families
                  of models. In this study, the authors show how
                  psychological concepts originating in the classic
                  signal-detection theory (SDT), a small-world
                  approach to decision making, can be used to
                  understand the workings of a class of simple models
                  known as fast-and-frugal trees (FFTs). Results
                  indicate that (a) the setting of the subjective
                  decision criterion in SDT corresponds directly to
                  the choice of exit structure in an FFT; (b) the
                  sensitivity of an FFT (measured in d′) is reflected
                  by the order of cues searched and the properties of
                  cues in an FFT, including the mean and variance of
                  cues' individual d′s, the intercue correlation, and
                  the number of cues; and (c) compared with the ideal
                  and the optimal sequential sampling models in SDT
                  and a majority model with an information search
                  component, FFTs are extremely frugal (i.e., do not
                  search for much cue information), highly robust, and
                  well adapted to the payoff structure of a
                  task. These findings demonstrate the potential of

                  information from memory), (ii) do not necessarily
                  use all available information, and process the

                  a discussion of its relationship to soft and hard

  abstract={Humans and animals make inferences about the world under

                  of rational inference treat the mind as a Laplacean
                  Demon, equipped with unlimited time, knowledge, and
                  computational might. Following H. Simon's notion of
                  satisficing, the authors have proposed a family of
                  algorithms based on a simple psychological
                  mechanism: one-reason decision making. These fast
                  and frugal algorithms violate fundamental tenets of
                  classical rationality: They neither look up nor
                  integrate all information. By computer simulation,
                  the authors held a competition between the
                  satisficing "Take The Best" algorithm and various
                  "rational" inference procedures (e.g., multiple
                  regression). The Take The Best algorithm matched or
                  outperformed all competitors in inferential speed
                  and accuracy. This result is an existence proof that
                  cognitive mechanisms capable of successful
                  performance in the real world do not need to satisfy
                  the classical norms of rational inference.}

                  of engineered systems such as airplane engines and
                  buildings. Cognitive systems, like biological and
                  engineered systems, exist within variable

                  cognitive systems achieve similarly high degrees of

                  have been shown to be both accurate and frugal in

                  simplicity and success of these heuristics comes
                  from using an appropriate cue order.  For instance,

                  orders as well.  Here we consider a range of simple
                  cue ordering mechanisms, including tallying,
                  swapping, and move-to-front rules, and show that
                  they can find cue orders that lead to reasonable
                  accuracy and considerable frugality when used with
                  lexicographic decision heuristics.},
